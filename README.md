#### Question 1:

As explained [here](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/low-power/low-power-design/power-consumption/):
Total Power = P<sub>switching</sub> + P<sub>short-circuit</sub> + P<sub>leakage</sub>

Dynamic power is the sum of two factors: switching power plus short-circuit power. Switching power is dissipated when charging or discharging internal and net capacitances. Short-circuit power is the power dissipated by an instantaneous short-circuit connection between the supply voltage and the ground at the time the gate switches state.

Leakage power is a function of the supply voltage, the switching threshold voltage, and the transistor size.
